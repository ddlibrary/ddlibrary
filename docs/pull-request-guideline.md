# Pull Request Guideline
1. Please find an issue you want to work on and make sure you know the problem or requested feature very well.
2. Make sure you have a fork of the project under your own GitHub account. If not, first get a fork.
3. Make sure you configured the `origin` and `upstream` in your local setup. `origin` should have your fork address and `upstream` should have the main repository remote url. You can look [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork), if you want to setup or check your setup.
4. Make sure your local master branch and your fork master branches are all synced with the latest changes in the `upstream` repository. You can look [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork) to learn more.
5. Create a branch in this format: `iX-fix`. For example: `i45-fix` where i is for issue, 45 being the issue number.
6. Create a pull request and get it reviewed. After successful review, your contribution will be merged to the main repository.
